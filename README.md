## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack application developed for BMW's Internal Battery Software Development / Full Stack Development (f/m/x) aptitude test.  

It demonstrates hands-on experience with a modern full-stack architecture using React (frontend), Node JS/Express (backend), and MySQL (database) with additional support for TypeORM, Swagger, and Postman.

The application manages Electric Car Data, providing:
- A backend REST API with full CRUD and filtering capabilities.  
- A React based frontend featuring an AG Grid table with server-side search, sort, and filter.  
- Soft-delete functionality via an `is_active` flag.  
- Swagger-based API documentation.
